>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Harmsen J-F, van Weeghel M, Parsons R, Janssens GE, Wefers J, van Moorsel D, et al. Divergent remodeling of the skeletal muscle metabolome over 24Â h between young, healthy men and older, metabolically compromised men. *Cell Reports* 2022;41(11):111786. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111786.

The `circacompare_mixed()` function from the `{circacompare}` R package was modified to produce the plots in the paper and to speed up computation when analysing data from many metabolites.
